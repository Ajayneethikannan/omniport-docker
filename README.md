## Docker distribution

This is the official Docker distribution of Omniport. Do note that although 
every effort has been made to generalise this Docker container set, this 
distribution involves a lot of assumptions and sensible defaults, changing which 
will probably lead to a lot of anguish.

## Technological stack

- Containerisation: `Docker`
- Orchestration: `Docker Compose`

This Dockerised setup is the preferred mode of installation. You can however set 
all the components up yourself, after suffering a reasonable amount of 
headbanging, cursing, and physical and mental pain.

## Contribution guidelines

- Branch out to `a_meaningful_branch_name`.

It's that simple!
