# Logos

Every portal deserves its own branding. Omniport supports easy branding of the portal to customise it for your institute.

# How to use

To brand your portal easily, just load the logo of your institute, the maintainers and the portal in this folder with the names `institute.png`, `maintainers.png` and `portal.png` respectively.

If you maintain multiple sites with different logos, you can load multiple logos as `portal_{SITE_ID}.png` and Omniport will smartly display the correct logo on the correct site.
